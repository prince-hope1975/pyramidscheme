# Tutorial: Pyramid Scheme
Simply put a pyramid/ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment that is setup in a way, that requires using new members deposits to pay out old members. More on that  [here](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-a-pyramid-scheme/).  
 If you've ever wondered what it would be like to build your very own fully functional, money making pyramid scheme, that's also blockchain based, and you would like to join the ranks of the great ponzi schemeres, then this is the tutorial for you. The tutorial will walk you through how to get started using `Reach`, `Javascript`, and `Next` to build your very own pyramid scheme and deploy it to the Algorand chain or any of the chains supported by reach.

## Aim

The tutorial aims to give you solid knowledge required to get you started building your own protocols and DApps on the blockchain. It will give you an overview of what it takes to create a smartcontract and create User Interfaces that interact with such contracts, all with the help of a powerful tool called `Reach`.

The tutorial assumes Zero knowledge of working with `Reach`, but will advice you at least know the basics of programming, before going through this tutorial.This is to enable you get the best out of this tutorial but not a prerequisite. 

## Prerequisites
If you need help installing Reach and its prerequisites then get started at our [Quick Installation Guide](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/#quickstart)


## Getting Started
We assume that you’ll go through this tutorial in a directory named ~/reach/scheme:

`$ mkdir -p ~/reach/scheme`

And that you have gone through the reach istallationprocess or have a copy of Reach installed in ~/reach so you can write

`$ ../reach version`

You should start by initializing your project. In the current directory start by pasting the below command in the terminal.

`$ ../reach init`

This initializes a new reach project and creates two files, `index.rsh` and `index.mjs`.

Your folder structure should look something like this

![folder](https://i.ibb.co/hKCrRJ1/Folder-Structure.png")

The `index.rsh` file should look something like this.

```js
1.   'reach 0.1';
2.
3.  export const main = Reach.App(() => {
4.   const A = Participant('Alice', {
5.    // Specify Alice's interact interface here
6.   });
7.   const B = Participant('Bob', {
8.     // Specify Bob's interact interface here
9.   });
10.  init();
11.  // The first one to publish deploys the contract
12.  A.publish();
13.  commit();
14.  // The second one to publish always attaches
15.  B.publish();
16.  commit();
17.  // write your program here
19.  exit();
20. });
```

Let's break down the above code block.

Line 1. specifies the version of reach that the compiler will use.

Lines 3 creates a reach module and exports it as `main`. The syntax allows other reach contracts to import different reach modules and use their code.

Lines 4 and 7 define the various participants of the application and store the participants "Alice" and "Bob" in constants "A" and "B" respectively. That is, it tells the reach program who has access to the contract, what methods they can call and what actions they can perform.

Line 10 initializes the contract and allows for custom logic.

Line 12 and 15 are used to make private variables of each participant public and in 13 and 16, the "commit" statement ends the current consensus step and allows more local steps.

_Lets look at the `index.mjs` file next_

```ts
1. import {loadStdlib} from '@reach-sh/stdlib';
2. import * as backend from './build/index.main.mjs';
3. const stdlib = loadStdlib(process.env);
4.
5. const startingBalance = stdlib.parseCurrency(100);
6.
7. const [ accAlice, accBob ] =
8.  await stdlib.newTestAccounts(2, startingBalance);
9. console.log('Hello, Alice and Bob!');
10.
11. console.log('Launching...');
12. const ctcAlice = accAlice.contract(backend);
13. const ctcBob = accBob.contract(backend, ctcAlice.getInfo());
14.
15. console.log('Starting backends...');
16. await Promise.all([
15.  backend.Alice(ctcAlice, {
16.    ...stdlib.hasRandom,
17.    // implement Alice's interact object here
18.  }),
19.  backend.Bob(ctcBob, {
20.    ...stdlib.hasRandom,
21.    // implement Bob's interact object here
22.  }),
23. ]);

console.log('Goodbye, Alice and Bob!');
```

The above code block is not "reach" specific. For simplicity's sake, we will breeze through the code execution.

At the top, we import the required modules `loadstdlib` from `@reach/-sh/stdlib` and the reach compiled backend. We create a starting balance on line 5, then initialize two accounts we use for testing `accAlice` and `accBob` on line 7. We make `accAlice` deploy the contract and `accBob` attaches to that contract on lines 12 & 13. On lines 16 to 22, we implement both Alice's and Bob's interact objects.

This is now enough for Reach to compile and run our program. Let's try running

```bash
../reach run
```

Reach should now build and launch a Docker container for this application. Since the application doesn't do anything, you'll just see a lot of diagnostic messages though, so that's not very exciting

## Battleship custom logic

Let's start by defining the processes and steps that will take place in the application.

- Two participants `A` and `B` will connect to the contract.
- `A` sets a wager and a deadline and pays the wager amount into the contract.
- `B` accepts the wager and pays into the contract
- Both participants take turns placing their ships on a board with 100 spots.
- The contract makes sure that `A ` doesn't know the contents of `B`'s board and vice versa.
- `A` takes a turn trying to guess the position of the ships placed on `B`'s board.
- `B` takes their turn trying to hit the ships on `A`'s board.
- The game ends when all the ships on any player's board have been hit.

## Implementation

Now we should implement the code logic for our `index.rsh` and `index.mjs`.  
 We start by adding the new interface objects that both participants have in common.

```js
1. const common = {
2.   getBoard: Fun([], Array(UInt, 100)),
3.   Ship: Array(Bool, 15),
4.   updateShip: Fun([], Null),
5.   seeOutcome: Fun([Bool], Null),
6.   informTimeout: Fun([], Null),
7.   getShip: Fun([], Array(Bool, 15)),
8.   getHand: Fun([], UInt),
9. };
```

The `common` object contains all the functions and methods that both participants will inherit and use. 
- `getBoard` is a function that gets an array of 100 UInts that contains the positions of the ships, which are represented by "1".
- `Ship` is a variable that is used to store an array of booleans that will represent the state of all the ships that have been hit. "False"  if the ship has not been hit and "true" if has been hit.
- `updateShip` updates the `Ship` and it is only called if a ship has been hit on the board.
- `seeOutcome` is used to display the winner of the game.
- `informTimeout` is used to notify the participants a timeout occured, and tell them they're taking too long to respond.
- `getShip` gets the updated `Ship` variable from the front.
- `getHand` this is then used to guess the position of a ship on another player's game board.

We're going to represent the cost of a wager with UInt (Unsigned Integer). The deployer will set this value after deploying the contract. We'll also represent the duration of a deadline with UInt.

Attacher has a function that lets them view and accepts the wager set by the deployer. They'll have the option of refusing it and thus terminating the contract.


From here we define the player's interact functions and create helper functions.
```js
13. export const main = Reach.App(() => {
14.  const Alice = Participant("Alice", {
15.    ...common,
16.    wager: UInt,
17.    deadline: UInt,
18.  });
19.  const Bob = Participant("Bob", {
20.    ...common,
21.    acceptWager: Fun([UInt], Null),
22.  });
23.  init();
24.
25.  const informTimeout = () => {
26.    each([Alice, Bob], () => {
27.      interact.informTimeout();
28.    });
29.  };
30.  const countShips = (ships) => Array.count(ships, (item) => {
31.    return item == true;
32.  });
33.  const winner = (AliceShips, BobShips) => AliceShips[14] ? true : BobShips[14] ? false : true
34.
```  
- Lines 14 to 18 create Participant `Alice` and give it its participant interface.
- Lines 19 to 21 define the participant `Bob` and give it its participant interface  
- Line 15 and 20 use the spread operator to add all the properties of `common` to the respective participant classes
- Line 25 initializes a function `informTimeout` that when called will call each participant's timeout Function that was defined in the `common` object.
- Line 30 initializes a function `countShips` that takes in an array of booleans and counts the number of true elements, to help determine if all the ships have been hit.
- Line 33 initializes a function `winner` that calculates the winner of the game.

The application is beginning to take shape. We have defined the parameters and helper functions that will be used throughout the reach contract, now we begin the implementation.  
```js
36.  Alice.only(() => {
37.    const board = declassify(interact.getBoard());
38.    const wager = declassify(interact.wager);
39.    const deadline = declassify(interact.deadline);
40.    const shipAlice = declassify(interact.Ship);
41.  });
42.
43.  Alice.publish(wager, deadline, shipAlice).pay(wager);
44.  commit();
45.
46.  Bob.only(() => {
47.    const board = declassify(interact.getBoard());
48.    interact.acceptWager(wager);
49.  });
50.
51.   
52.   // Make sure neither parties have acces to each other board
53.  
54.  unknowable(Bob, Alice(board));
55.  unknowable(Alice, Bob(board));
56.
57.
58.  Bob.pay(wager).timeout(relativeTime(deadline), () =>
59.    closeTo(Alice, informTimeout)
60.  );
61.
```
- Lines 36 to 42 indicate that it is an action that only Alice performs. Alice gets the `board`, `wager`, `deadline` and `AliceShip` from the front end of our application.
- Line 43 Alice publishes the `wager`, `deadline`, and `shipAlice` variables, and makes them available to the entire application. Alice also pays the wager amount gotten from the front-end into the contract, by appending the `pay` method to the `publish`. 

If you'd notice alice makes every other variable available but, keeps the board to only herself. The reason is Bob isn't supposed to know what is on Alice's board and vice versa. So the board of each participant mustn't be shared. 
- Lines 46 to 49 indicate an action that only Bob performs. Bob gets the board from the front end and keeps it to himself by not publishing it. Bob also informs the front-end that the wager should be accepted by calling `interact.acceptWager(wager)`.
- Lines 54 and 55 do a check and make sure that neither Alice nor Bob know the contents of the opponent's board. Just an extra layer of security to ensure honesty.
- Line 58 Bob is prompted to pay the wager amount specified by Alice if he accepts the wager. The timeout method ensures that if Bob refuses to pay the wager or for some reason is unable to pay; when the timer runs out, the code block will be executed.

Moving forward to the main application logic, we have a loop that will run until the application execution ends and a winner is decided. It will look something like this.

```js
62.  var statement = [true, 0, 0, shipAlice, shipAlice];
63.  invariant(balance() == 2 * wager);
64.  while (statement[0]) {
65.    const [isTrue, aliceShipCount, BobShipsCount, A, B] = statement
66.    commit();
67.
68.    // Get Alice's Hand
69.    Alice.only(() => {
70.      const handAlice = declassify(interact.getHand());
71.    });
72.    Alice.publish(handAlice);
73.    commit();
74.
75.    // Bob Plays his Hand
76.    // Compare with bobs Board and check if it's been hit
77.
78.    Bob.only(() => {
79.      const bobHand = declassify(interact.getHand());
80.      const BobVal = board[handAlice % 100] == 1;
81.      if (BobVal) {
82.        interact.updateShip();
83.      }
84.      const BobShips = declassify(interact.getShip());
85.      check(countShips(BobShips) <= BobShipsCount + 1, "Dishonest front")
86.    });
87.    Bob.publish(bobHand, BobShips);
88.    commit();
89.
90.    // Alice Checks if the she has been hit and then publishes the result
91.    Alice.only(() => {
92.      const val = board[bobHand % 100] == 1;
93.      if (val) {
94.        interact.updateShip();
95.      }
96.      const AliceShips = declassify(interact.getShip());
97.      check(countShips(AliceShips) <= aliceShipCount + 1, "Dishonest front")
98.
99.    });
100.    Alice.publish(AliceShips);
101.
102.    const countBob = countShips(BobShips)
103.    const countAlice = countShips(AliceShips);
104.
105.    statement = [
106.      AliceShips[14] || BobShips[14] ? false : true,
107.      countAlice,
108.      countBob,
109.      AliceShips, BobShips
110.    ]
111.    continue;
112.  }

```
**NOTE: REACH VARIABLES ARE IMMUTABLE BY DEFAULT AND CAN NOT BE CHANGED EXCEPT PRECEDING THE CONTINUATION OF A LOOP (i.e BEFORE  A `CONTINUE`). VARs CAN ONLY BE DECLARED AT THE BEGINING OF A LOOP. THIS RESTRICTION IS PUT IN PLACE FOR SECURITY REASONS**  
Moving on in our application implementation...
- Line 62 declares a Tuple named `statement` that stores different variables used thorough out the execution of the code.
- Line 63 declares the `invariant` block of the loop. This is a condition that will remain true regardless of the steps taken in the loop. As for our use, we declare that the balance in the contract will always be equal to twice the wager amount.
- Line 64 begins the execution of the while loop and ends in line 112.
- Line 65 destructures the `statement` variable and assigns individual variables to each parameter.
- Lines 69 to 72 get Alice's hand and publish it so Bob can use it to compare with his board.
- Lines 78 to 87, Bob gets his hand from the front end as well as doing a comparison to check if Alice's hand was correct. If it's correct Bob updates his `Ship` variable. After all the steps Bob publishes both the updated value of the ship and his hand, that is `BobShips` and `BobHand`.
- Lines 91 to 100, Alice also does a comparison with her board and Bob's hand. After all the checks and comparisons, Alice publishes the "ship" variable to be used elsewhere in the application.
- Lines 102 and 103 use the function declared earlier on line 30, to count and store the number of ships that have been hit on each participant board.
- Lines 105 to 110 show how we mutate the statement variable and input new values.

That is all the logic needed in the loop, for the game to run.

Our application needs a way to determine the winner and pay the total funds to the winner. We will implement that below.
```js
114.  const [isTrue, aliceShipCount, BobShipsCount, AliceShips, BobShips] = statement
115.
116.  const outcome = winner(AliceShips, BobShips);
117.  transfer(2 * wager).to(outcome ? Alice : Bob);
118.  commit();
119.
120.  each([Alice, Bob], () => {
121.    interact.seeOutcome(outcome);
122.  });
123. });
```
- Line  114 destructures all the values from the `statement` variable.
- On line 116 we determine the outcome of the game and return stores a "true" if Alice wins and a "false" if Bob wins  
- Line 117 transfers the total amount in the contract to the winner and then performs a commit.
- Lines 120 t0 123, each participant is notified of the outcome of the game.

And that's it with our blockchain implementation. 

Running...
``` bash
  ../reach compile
```
we should see an output on the terminal like this

```bash
Verifying knowledge assertions
Verifying for generic connector
  Verifying when ALL participants are honest
  Verifying when NO participants are honest
Checked 43 theorems; No failures!

```
Bringing the application together; will look something like this...

## Assertion Insertion

Due to the simplicity of the program, there's no need for assertions in the code.

## Possible Additions

Our code works perfectly fine as it is now. But can be implemented and represented better by using APIs instead of Participants for the player interactions

## Testing

We test our application by editing the `index.mjs` file that was created when we ran

```bash
../reach init
```

We define our test data to use for simulating user input and data

```js
4. export const Data = [
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
];
5. export const playerChoice = [
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8,
];
```

On the Data array "0"s represent spaces on the board without ships and the "1"s represent ships.

The player choice array contains all the moves the test suite will guess on the board.

```js
9. const stdlib = loadStdlib();
10. const startingBalance = stdlib.parseCurrency(100);
11.
12. const accAlice = await stdlib.newTestAccount(startingBalance);
13. const accBob = await stdlib.newTestAccount(startingBalance);
14.
15. const getBalance = async (who) =>
16.  stdlib.formatCurrency(await stdlib.balanceOf(who), 4);
17. const beforeAlice = await getBalance(accAlice);
18. const beforeBob = await getBalance(accBob);
19.
20. const ctcAlice = accAlice.contract(backend);
21. const ctcBob = accBob.contract(backend, ctcAlice.getInfo());
```
The above code block does the following
- We load the reach standard library on line 9
- On line 10 we create a starting balance for each player
- On lines 12 and 13 we create two test accounts and fund them programmatically
- On line 15 we create a `getBalance` helper function we use later in the application.
- On lines 17 and 18 we get the balances of the accounts before they interact with the contract we wrote in the `index.rsh`.
- On line 20 participant  `Alice   deploys the contract and Bob attaches to that contract on line 21

Now let's define the equivalent of the `common` variable in our `index.rsh` file. We name it `Player` instead and it will mirror the `common` variable.
The Player function will return an object and will be spread to both participant's interact objects.
```js
1. const Player = () => {
2.  let Ship = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,];
3.  let i =0
4.  const getBoard = () => {
5.    console.log(`Bob asked to give the preimage.`);
6.    return Data;
7.  };
8.  const updateShip = () => {
9.    for (let singleShip in Ship) {
10.      if (Ship[singleShip] === false) {
11.        Ship[singleShip] = true;
12.        break;

```
In the code block above, we have a factory function that returns all the needed parameters which we defined during the implementation of the reach code.
we have
- `Ship` variable that will be updated when given the orders from the contract.
- `getBoard` function that returns the player board with the position where ships are placed.
- `updateShip` which updates the `Ship` variable by changing a single value from false to true.
- `informTimeout` which just logs a warning to the console.
- `seeOutcome` that prints the outcome of the game to the console.
- `getShip` which is used in the contract to determine the current state of the `Ship` variable.
- `getHand` that gets the current hand of the player.

We start interacting with the contract and fill up the participant's interface with the mirror of the smart contract equivalent, and wrap it in a "promise.all" statement to make sure they both run and resolve simultaneously.
```js
61. await Promise.all([
62.  backend.Alice(ctcAlice, {
63.    ...Player(),
64.    amt: stdlib.parseCurrency(25),
65.    deadline: 10,
66.    wager: stdlib.parseCurrency(10),
67.  }),
68.  backend.Bob(ctcBob, {
69.    ...Player(),
70.    acceptWager: async () => {
71.      if (Math.random() >= 1) {
72.        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
73.          console.log(`  Bob takes his sweet time...`);
74.          await stdlib.wait(1);
75.        }
76.      } else {
77.          await stdlib.wait(1);
78.        console.log(`Bob accepts the wager .`);
79.      }
80.    },
81.  }),

That is it. You should have an implementation of battleship and a test file running on your local machine.
## Further Learning
If you want to implement a more complex front-end Application using a front-end library (REACT, Vue, Angular, etc). Continue to get an idea of how reach can be used when building fullstack blockchain applications.


NOTE: To fully utilize this section you need to have the repo locally [link](https://github.com/prince-hope1975/battleship-main)


Now we have a complete contract backend and test suite, now we can write the frontend. You can use any frontend library of your choice. In our case, we have chosen to use React.  
In the React App navigate to `battleship-main/src/factories/playerFactory.js`. We are defining the logic for the participants
