## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Having a fair implementation of Battleship on the blockchain is fairly difficult, and that's exactly what is implemented on this repo using reach.

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- React
- Reach
- Reach stdlib


## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
The hack provided me with the knowledge to build complex blockchain applications, but there were a couple of things that couldn't be implemented, which will be implemented in the future, such as;
- Using APIs instead of participants to enable a more fluid user experience.


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get this project running on your local environment for development `docker` and `docker compose ` are needed

### Prerequisites
- reach 
- reach-sh/stdlib
- Node js

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- Navigate to the home page.
- Either connect your wallet or use the default account to play
- Insert name
- Choose spots to place ships
- Once ships have been placed wait for the contract to communicate with the blockchain
- You will be prompted to guess the position of the opponent's ship
- Keep on playing till all ships are destroyed
